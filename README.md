## Architecture & Design

- **Separation of Concerns**: Frontend and backend are developed and maintained independently
- **MongoDB Schema Design**:
  - `Users`: Authentication, roles (user/admin), and profile data
  - `Items`: Specialized product models by category (e.g., electronics, furniture, shoes, vinyl)
  - `Reviews`: Linked to products and users for relational integrity
- **Inheritance Model**: Product categories extend a base item model with custom attributes
- **Authentication Flow**: Secure login/registration with JWT tokens and password hashing via `bcrypt`
- **Responsive UI**: Designed to work across all devices for a better shopping experience
